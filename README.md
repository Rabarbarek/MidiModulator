MidiModulator
=============

This Python script will take a song and modulate the pitch with the melody of a chosen score (basically, another song). Made at MusicHackDay London 2013

Used software and APIs:
- Deezer: download a song
- EchoNest (python): chop it up in little chunks
- MuseScore: download a melody
- SonicAPI: pitch-shift ALL the chunks
- music21: get the pitches out of the score
- SoX: glue it back together at the end
